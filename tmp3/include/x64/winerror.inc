; OLE error definitions and values
; The return value of OLE APIs and methods is an HRESULT.
; This is not a handle to anything, but is merely a 32-bit value
; with several fields encoded in the value.The parts of an
; HRESULT are shown below.
; Many of the macros and functions below were orginally defined to
; operate on SCODEs.SCODEs are no longer used.The macros are
; still present for compatibility and easy porting of Win16 code.
; Newly written code should use the HRESULT macros and functions.

;HRESULTs are 32 bit values layed out as follows:
; 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
; 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
;+-+-+-+-+-+---------------------+-------------------------------+
;|S|R|C|N|r|Facility | Code|
;+-+-+-+-+-+---------------------+-------------------------------+
;where
;S - Severity - indicates success/faih
;0 - Success
;1 - Fail (COERROR)
;R - reserved portion of the facility code, corresponds to NT's
;second severity bit.
;C - reserved portion of the facility code, corresponds to NT's
;C field.
;N - reserved portion of the facility code. Used to indicate a
;mapped NT status value.
;r - reserved portion of the facility code. Reserved for internah
;use. Used to indicate HRESULT values that are not status
